## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [React Spring](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-spring) - For animations

### What I learned

Again coding mobile first was a great idea. It made getting the initial work completed easy, and then scaling it up to desktop sort of just seemed like a breeze.

I was very pleased with the final results of the animations, especially desktop. On this project in particular I controlled the react-spring configurations by nesting ternaries. It's not very readable, but I give myself extra cool points for doing it. I also realized you can control the clamp of the config and other spring settings with different states. 

### Continued development

If I was going to finish this, or come across this again, I'd work harder to match the image position and scale with the design. I thought it looked fine as it was, but in the future should definitely take the time to figure out how to do what the design is calling for.
